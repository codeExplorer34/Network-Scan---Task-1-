# Nmap Local Network Scan - Submission (TASK 1)

## Objective
Discover open ports on local network to understand service exposure and risks.

## Environment
- OS: Windows 10
- Local IP: 192.168.1.168
- Network range scanned: 192.168.1.0/24
- Tools used: Nmap 7.98, Npcap, (Wireshark optional)

## Command used
`nmap -sS -T4 --open -oN scanned_results.txt 192.168.1.0/24`

## Findings (important)
- `192.168.1.1 (eLifeConnect - Arcadyan)`  
  - Ports: 53/tcp (domain), 80/tcp (http), 443/tcp (https), 49152/tcp (unknown/ephemeral)
- `192.168.1.131` (printer)  
  - Ports: 80/tcp (http), 443/tcp (https), 515/tcp (printer), 631/tcp (ipp), 9100/tcp (jetdirect)
- `192.168.1.147`  
  - Ports: 80/tcp (http)
- `192.168.1.154`  
  - Ports: 60020/tcp (unknown), 62078/tcp (iphone-sync)
- `192.168.1.155`  
  - Ports: 49152/tcp (unknown), 62078/tcp (iphone-sync)
- `192.168.1.168 (my PC)`  
  - Ports: 135/tcp (msrpc), 139/tcp (netbios-ssn), 445/tcp (microsoft-ds - SMB)

## Analysis and Risks
- SMB (ports 139/445) on my PC is high-risk â€” can expose file shares and be targeted by exploits.
- Router admin/web interfaces must be secured and firmware updated.
- Printer exposes printing protocols that can be abused to leak documents or pivot.
- Unknown ephemeral ports (49152, 60020) require version detection to see which service is running.

## Recommendations
1. Disable unused services (turn off File & Printer Sharing if not needed).  
2. Update firmware and change default passwords on router and printer.  
3. Disable UPnP if not required.  
4. Use firewall rules to restrict SMB and other sensitive ports.  
5. Put IoT/printers on a separate guest/VLAN network if possible.
